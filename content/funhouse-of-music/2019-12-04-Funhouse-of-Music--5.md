Jonas pulled the bass from the wall, picked up a quarter-inch cable, plugged the cable into the guitar and a nearby amp, and flipped on the amp. The amp warmed up and hummed with potential energy. He slapped a string and a big tone came forth. He handed the instrument to Mary. It was the size of her torso. She rested it carefully on her leg and wrapped her arm around it. She held down a string and plucked. Then she played the bass line to _Superman_ by ear. First slowly, then faster and with more confidence. Jonas stood, mouth agape. 

She sat there for a few seconds and then played _Fall On Me_. Then _Cuyahoga_. Then _Save It for Later_. Jonas continued in his speechlessness. She handed the bass back and he took it. 

"Mary, that was amazing," was all he could say.

"Thanks," was all she could say.

When her mother came back to pick her up, Mary went straight to the car as she always did, but her mother stayed on the porch of the house talking with Jonas. Finally, she came back to the car, and after backing out of the driveway and getting going down the street, said, "Jonas says you have a real talent for the bass guitar."

"I guess," said Mary.

"Interesting," said her mother.
