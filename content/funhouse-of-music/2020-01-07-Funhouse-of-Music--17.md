The first house show was incredible. It was Dude's idea, Mary enthusiastically agreed it was a good one, and it only took about a minute of convincing to get Jonas onboard. They scheduled rehersals, picked a date, Dude started sketching a flyer and Jonas picked out a stack of records for Mary to listen to.

"Let me know which of these you like," he said. She accepted the stack into her outstretched arms. Just then her mother pulled into the driveway.

"What do you think?" Dude was holding up a small sheet of paper with stylized letters penciled across it:

> Funhouse of Music

"I like it," Mary said. Jonas just raised one eyebrow.

When Mary returned for their first rehearsal Jonas immediately inquired about the records. 

"I liked them all," she replied, "But I want to play these too," and held out two tapes: The Police's *Ghost in the Machine* and *Friend Or Foe* by Adam Ant.

"Which tracks?"

"*Goody Two Shoes*..."

"Of course," he cut her off.

"And *Every Little Thing She Does is Magic*."

"Naturally. Any more?"

"No, that will do."

"Great."

"Dude! Stewart Copeland!" It was a different voice, coming from a tall, lanky man screwing cymbals onto stands.

"Mary, meet Joe. He's going to play drums for us."

"Joe and Jonas?" Mary asked incredulously.
