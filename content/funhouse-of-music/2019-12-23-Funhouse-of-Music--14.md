About that time, Mary's mom returned to pick her up from what she thought was a normal, hopefully innocent band practice.

"Shit, do not tell my mom about this," Mary implored.

"Don't worry, I don't even know what I would tell her," Jonas replied.

"Just tell her the truth, this house is haunted," suggested Dude. He was entertaining himself nonstop at this point.

Jonas walked with Mary out to the car. Her mom rolled down the window and Jonas leaned over to talk into the driver-side window. Mary's mom looked at him with a look that for the first time made him think maybe there was more at work here than just Mary's freak talent for new wave and rock. 

"Well, if she wants to keep practicing with us, we'd love to have her."

"Would you like that, honey?" Mary's mom asked to the back seat as Mary climbed in.

"Yeah," Mary said.

"We can just do this same time next week," Jonas offered. 

"Sounds good!" Mary's mom said, a bit too enthusiastically. She flipped the car into reverse and bounced out of the driveway.

Jonas walked back into the house. "Dude, I think Mary's mom is into me."

"Good thing you like older women!" Dude could not be stopped.
