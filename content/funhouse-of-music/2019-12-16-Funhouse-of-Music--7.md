The next week Mary played _Pump It Up_ perfectly, as Jonas played guitar and sang. When she burst forth with the opening line, his insides flew. He smiled uncontrollably. 

Jonas was in a duo, a bar band that played covers. The Elvis Costello tunes were his favorite of their setlist. In the previous week, he had added the English Beat as well.

His bandmate played keys, and even though Jonas could play them better, he preferred guitar. They both held down the singing.

Jonas had a P.A. system set up in the house this time. "Let's play _Save It for Later_ again," he suggested as he flipped it on. They broke into the tune and he did his best English accent singing.

"Ok, we'd better practice some piano now or your mother will kill me," he said after they finished. For some reason Mary conjured a vision of her mom climbing out of the Cadillac sedan, brandishing a large pistol, taking aim at Jonas. It was comical and she laughed out loud just a little as she moved to the piano bench. 

As Mary walked to the door at the end of her lesson time, Jonas said, "I have this band...well, it's just two of us...anyway, I was wondering if you wanted to come play those two tunes with us next time we play. I'll talk to your mom about it."

"Sure," Mary said nonchalantly.
