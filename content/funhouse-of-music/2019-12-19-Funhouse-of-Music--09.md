"So what happened?" Jonas asked at the start of Mary's next piano lesson.

"I don't know," replied Mary.

"Did you get nervous?"

"Not really. I just couldn't play like I could in here."

"Let's get through your piano music really quick and then practice those tunes again."

When they had run through Mary's piano lesson material, Jonas broke out the guitar and bass and plugged them in. He counted off _Pump It Up_ and they both played the song perfectly. Jonas smiled and when they had played the last note puzzled out loud, "I wonder what happened at Gilley's? You can play it perfectly here." Jonas thought silently for a moment. "I'm going to see if your mom will let you come to our next practice."

"Here they come," said Jonas to his bandmate. "Put out that cigarette!"

His bandmate looked confused, shrugged, and put the cigarette out in the large glass ashtray on the floor. Jonas grabbed the ashtray and hid it on a ledge around the corner. Mary's mother didn't accompany her to the door, so the urgency was a little unnecessary, other than for not contributing to the delinquency of a minor.

They started with _Save It for Later_ and Mary played it perfectly. The three of them were so tight, it sounded like they'd played together for years. Jonas's bandmate looked at him in disbelief, and Jonas looked back at him as if to say, "I told you!"

"That was really good, Mary."

They moved onto _Pump It Up_ and it was the same. Both songs she had been completely unable to play at the gig, she now played not only correctly, but flawlessly, with feeling and a level of mastery with the instrument well beyond what could be possible at her age.

Jonas had an idea. "We're going to play a different tune now." He counted off _(What's So Funny 'Bout) Peace, Love, and Understanding_ and the three of them played it like they were in The Attractions. Jonas even sounded a lot like Elvis Costello.
