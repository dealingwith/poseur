"Dude, we still don't know why this didn't work for years with her piano lessons," Jonas observed again.

Dude stroked his chin and suggested, "Try playing along with her."

Jonas had played classical duets with Mary before, but decided to humor his bandmate. He moved the keyboard behind the piano and asked Mary to play her current piano piece. They played the piece successfully but none of the magic was there.

"Maybe it's only music I like," said Mary.

"You don't like this classical music?" Jonas replied, a little offended.

"I mean. It's not that I don't like it. I just don't like-like it."

"We just threw a few new tunes at you and you played them perfectly. Did you know you liked them already, before we started?" asked Jonas's bandmate.

"No. But thinking back, I do like them all."

"What's a tune that you don't like."

"Well my mom is really into Sinatra and it kind of makes me want to gag."

"That's it! Get out!" Jonas's bandmate said sarcastically and guffawed loudly.

"Ok, dude, what Sinatra do we know?"

"_Fly Me to the Moon_?"

"Ok. Mary, you get back on bass...you haven't missed yet on bass," Jonas said and picked up a guitar as Dude scooted the keyboards back to where they would face Jonas.

>Fly me to the moon
>Let me play among the stars
>And let me see what spring is like
>On a-Jupiter and Mars

They took a second to find all the chords but they had both played in their university jazz band. Mary just sat there.

"Try," beseeched Jonas. Mary plucked a few sour notes and shrugged. 

"Well, I'll be damned. Girl only plays what she wants to play," Dude said and laughed again.
