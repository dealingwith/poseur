"I don't know. Just stopped doing them."

"Well, they were really good shows. Y'all should've played out more."

"Yeah, probably," Mary replied, heart still sinking at the memories, eight years old at this point.

"I see him," he said, looking in the distance into the backyard, and then hurried off after his friend.

"What is this? What was he talking about? Dish now, or I'll just find out from him later."

Mary sighed. She didn't want to stroll down this particular memory lane, nor did she want to give too much detail about the how or why of those shows in that house. "Yeah, I played some house shows with some older guys when I was ten."

"What?!"

"Yeah. It was with my piano teacher. We played R.E.M. and stuff." Mary was trying to downplay the entire experience. 

"What did you play?"

"Mostly bass."

"You can play bass?"

"Not really."

"You could play bass when you were ten but not now?" Mary's friend asked, incredulously.

"Right."

"That's weird."

"I know."

Mary was relieved when her friend suddenly became distracted by the appearance of a boy she liked.
