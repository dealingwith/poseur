Next, they played _Accidents Will Happen_. Then _Cruel to Be Kind_ by Nick Lowe. _Burning Down the House_ and _Once in a Lifetime_ by Talking Heads. Despite having seen this several times previously, Jonas was in complete shock. No matter what they threw at her, she played it perfectly the first time. His bandmate was more skeptical. “I want to try something,” he said, and stepped out from behind the keyboard, grabbing a tambourine. “Follow me. Bring the guitars.”

He walked out the front door and Jonas and Mary looked at each other, shrugged like they were in a comedic sitcom, and followed. He started to tap out the eighth-note beat of _Once in a Lifetime_ on the tambourine, announced which tune it was, and counted off. Jonas caught on immediately and started strumming the chords. Mary just stood there, the bass now hanging low from the thick strap. Jonas saw her sudden hesitation and started singing the vocal melody loudly.

> And you may find yourself living in a shotgun shack

Mary tried. She just couldn’t find the notes. Or the groove. “I…I just can’t,” she said, visibly upset.

Jonas gave his bandmate a dirty look.

“Hang on. Follow me back inside.”

They marched back inside and as soon as they were all inside the front door he tapped out the beat on the tambourine again, this time picking up the vocals himself.

> And you may find yourself in a beautiful house, with a beautiful wife
> And you may ask yourself, “Well… how did I get here?”

Mary plucked at the thick strings with her tiny hands. The part was flawless. Her timekeeping was like a metronome.
