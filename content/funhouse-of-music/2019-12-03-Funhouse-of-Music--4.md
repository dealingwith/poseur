Three years later and Mary had asked for a Walkman for her birthday and bought _Life's Rich Pageant_ on cassette. She listened to it nonstop. The tape grew worn and warped the sound so she saved up and bought another copy.

She was ten and Jonas had her playing Beethoven piano sonatas, and after her practice sessions, she would learn _Cuyahoga_ by ear, belting out the chorus as loud as she could.

She saved up some more and bought _Reckoning_ and _Fables of the Reconstruction_. She drew the I.R.S. Man logo and Blu-tacked it to the wall in her bedroom. Her next tape purchase was _Special Beat Service_ by the English Beat. She dyed her brown hair black and begged her mother for a pair of Dr. Martens. Her mother would not acquiesce. The hair was quite enough, her mother would say.

"Can I see that?" Mary asked towards the end of one of her lessons as she pointed to the Fender Jazz Bass on the wall.
