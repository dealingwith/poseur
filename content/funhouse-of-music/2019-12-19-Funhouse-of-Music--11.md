They stopped after the first chorus. Jonas looked at his bandmate, who smiled back a toothy grin.

"How did you think of that?"

"I don't know, but this sure is interesting."

"Sure is."

Mary hadn't said a word, still grasping the situation herself. 

"What does it feel like?" Jonas asked her.

"I don't know. Fun, mostly. And when we were out there nothing. Just that same feeling you have any time you don't know what the fuck you're doing."

Jonas laughed out loud, embarrassed by the unexpected curse coming from the mouth of a girl. "Sorry," he said, still barely suppressing his laughter. He looked at his bandmate. "What do you make of it?"

"Dunno. Maybe this house is haunted by the ghost of some great bass player. His spirit floats up from his dismembered body hidden under the floorboards and embodies anyone who plays bass."

"Dude!" Jonas barked, still very protective of Mary.

"Sorry," he replied, chuckling.

"Besides," Jonas continued, "You and I have both played bass in this house and nothing like that happened."

"True. Mary, let's play that Talking Heads tune again, but this time you go play the keys."

"Ok," Mary replied, took off the bass, leaned it against the wall and walked behind the keyboard.

"I don't want to play bass," Jonas's bandmate said to him. Jonas shrugged and handed him the guitar and picked up the bass.

Jonas had a degree in music and knew the tune and had played it a hundred times on guitar and keyboards, but he still had to concentrate to keep on top of the bass part. Meanwhile, Mary played the keyboard with more soul than either of them ever had.
