Mary was a good student and a quick study, but one day she just wasn't feeling it. Her dad was long gone, her mother was busy with work and her various boyfriends, and Mary just hadn't practiced as much as she should have. She sat at the piano in the funhouse and made mistake after mistake. No energy flowed through her fingers. Jonus saw she was on the verge of tears.

"Somedays, you just aren't feeling it," he said. "And that's ok. There are usually a lot of reasons you might not be feeling it that day, usually more than one reason at a time. And the thing to do is not to just plow through, although the goal is to get through. The thing to do is take one step back and repeat that last step. Let's play last week's lesson."

He flipped the lesson book back a page, the page with last week's date and a big checkmark on it. Wordlessly, she began to play. The notes came much more easily. By the end of the piece her hands were moving freely again and the tears welled up in her eyes had dried.
