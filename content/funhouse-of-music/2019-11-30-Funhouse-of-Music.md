The house was crooked. Its paint, whatever was left of it, was of mysterious original coloration. The entire thing was made of wood, wood that creaked underfoot, creaked in the wind, creaked when the sounds and reverberations came from within it.

Mary's music lessons were in this house. Mary learned piano from Jonas. Jonas had gone to a local but prestigious school for jazz performance, moved to New York City, gained some significant fame, disappeared, and reappeared back here in his hometown, in this house.

There were instruments strewn all across the residence's main rooms--the stand-up piano, of course, where Mary played her lessons--but also guitars hung all over the walls, there was a drum set in the corner, a box of percussion, and various specifically ethnically-infused stringed instruments.

It was like the entire earth under that house had cracked. Mary remembers the giant but smooth oscillation in the road just prior to arriving. In the back seat of her mother's 1977 Cadillac Sedan de Ville, the pothole-bump combo sent Mary well off the seat, the suspension not recovering until they had made the left into the small stone driveway, Mary having been bounced across the seat to the passenger-side door. She would snatch her music from beside her and stumble unsteadily into the funhouse of music.
