Before the first show, Jonas spent the day sprucing up the house. He put candles in random spots, picked up, arranged the furniture--what furniture there was--just so. 

"You're welcome to stay," he said invitingly to Mary's mom when she dropped Mary off. 

"Oh, no. I would just feel old. Besides, I've heard some of the music Mary's brought home. Not my cup of tea."

"Ok, well, we'll not go too late. Is ten ok to pick her back up?"

"It's Friday. Sure."

"Great!" Jonas was relieved that she hadn't taken him up on his offer to stick around.

Guests started arriving, almost all of them friends of Jonas, Dude, and Joe, or their dates. Mostly musicians from the local music scene or people Jonas went to college with. Frequently both.

Normally the music would start later at something like this, but the gimmick was also the constraint: the ten-year-old girl who was going to shock and awe with her prowess at the bass guitar--or anything else they decided to throw at her tonight. Jonas was nervous. He wanted people to get there on time--he had instructed them to get there on time--but these were creatures of habit, and creatures of the night.
