At her next practice, Jonas had Mary run through her piano material very quickly, then instead of giving her more to work on he said, "I want you to play the bass again."

"Ok," she said. He pulled the same Fender Jazz Master off the wall and handed it to her.

"Play the same things you played last time."

"What did I play last time?"

"R.E.M."

"And the English Beat."

"Yes, and the English Beat."

Mary proceeded to play _Save It for Later_, here and there adding flourishes to the steady bass line.

Jonas picked up an electric guitar and began strumming without even plugging into an amp. He had a giant smile on his face. It inspired a smirk from Mary.

"I want to give you another record," he said after they finished the tune. He walked behind the piano to a series of milk crates laying on the floor. He flicked through the records inside the first crate and pulled out _This Year's Model_ by Elvis Costello and the Attractions. He handed it to Mary triumphantly. 

"Next week, we're going to play _Pump It Up_ from this record, ok?"

"Ok," she replied with a small shrug. "What about my piano?"

"Do the same music again for next week," Jonas said, forgetfully.
