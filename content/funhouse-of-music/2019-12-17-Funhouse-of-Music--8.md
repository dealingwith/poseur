"Just show up. We'll play those two songs. You don't need to practice. I'll bring the bass. I'll give your mom the address."

"Ok."

Jonas had picked an early show at one of the cleaner, well-lit bars his band of two frequently gigged at. As he set up, he kept his eye out for Mary and her mother. When they walked through the front door he could tell her mother was immediately scoping the place out, looking for signs that she should immediately escape with her daughter to a safer place. But apparently, she decided that this establishment was acceptable. Mary spotted him from across the large room and as he waved hello she quickly walked over.

"We'll play your tunes early on in the set," he told her, "In the meantime, you and your mom can just hang out? Sit anywhere you like." There weren't many patrons this early in the evening, so there were plenty of tables open, and the early evening light still shone through the ample windows. 

They played a couple of tunes and then he announced that they were going to have a special guest play with them. He called Mary up to the stage and encouraged fanfare from the crowd. It was clear they were equally shocked and impressed by her young age.

She sat with the bass and Jonas counted off the tune. She began to play but...nothing happened. Her hands didn't know which notes to play anymore. She tried, briefly, but had to stop. Jonas looked over, his face first confused and a little shocked, but after a second he just gave her a wink and continued with the song. After they had finished it, he leaned over. 

"What happened?"

"I don't know. I just don't know what to play...how to play...anymore," she said.

"Ok. That's ok," Jonas replied, still puzzled. "Want to try the other one?"

"I don't know."

"Well, give it a try," and he began to play the next song.

Her hands continued to disobey. They were rocks, ice cubes. She started to become embarrassed. She felt sweat start to drip from her armpits for the first time in her life. She glanced at her mother, who returned a warm smile, and in whose eyes were held that desire all parents have to save their daughters.
