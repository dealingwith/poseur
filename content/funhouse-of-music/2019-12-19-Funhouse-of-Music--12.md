"Mary, you're good at your piano music, but not that good. What's going on?"

"I don't know, it just came naturally."

"Dude, let's have her play the drums!" Jonas's bandmate said and quickly lit a cigarette and adjusted the drum kit and the drum throne. Jonas didn't even care about the cigarettes anymore.

"What do you want to play?"

"Do you know _Driver 8_ by R.E.M?"

"We don't, but we can figure it out really quick. I think I have the record." He dug through his record crates and soon found _Fables Of The Reconstruction_, putting it on the turntable and setting the needle on track 3. He turned the volume up and listened to the opening riff. "Oh, yes, I remember!" he exclaimed, grabbing the guitar back from his bandmate and playing along to the recording. He gave Mary a nod. She pounded the drums like some kind of combination of Bill Berry and Buddy Rich.

As they played along, Jonas's bandmate shouted at him over the music, "She's better at the drums than you are!"

"She's better at everything than we are!" Jonas shot back.

When they had finished, Jonas put his guitar down. "I have an idea." He practically skipped down the hall, ducking into one of the rooms. He returned shortly with a sitar. "Try this!"

He instructed Mary on how to sit and placed the instrument in front of her. He picked up an acoustic guitar and began playing _Norwegian Wood_. Her sitar technique was flawless.
