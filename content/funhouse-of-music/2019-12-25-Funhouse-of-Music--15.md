_Zombie_ by The Cranberries was playing loudly on the home stereo. Parents were gone for the weekend, so teenagers had gathered, and Mary's best friend had dragged her there. They stood with red Solo cups in hand, some disgusting combination of fruit punch and rum swirling in them, and their heads in it.

"My brother just walked in," Mary's friend said casually as she looked towards the front door. Said brother was older, in college, and was one of those cool, paternalistic older brothers. He wasn't there to monitor or mock. He just happened to have some friends there, too. He spotted his sister and walked over.

"Hey."

"Hey."

"Is this party any good?"

"Not really."

"Cool. Have you seen Judge?"

"No, but he might be. I saw some of your other friends."

"Oh yeah? Who?"

"The ones whose names I don't know," Mary's friend said and rolled her eyes dramatically.

"Right." Suddenly, he did a double-take in Mary's direction. "Hey, I remember you!"

"Yes, my friend, Mary." Except Mary had never met him. He'd been gone every time she happened to have been at their house.

"No, I remember you from those house shows. You were young then."

Mary just stared in response. Like she had been caught stealing once when she was five.

"Yeah, that was you, right?"

"Yeah, it was."

"Whatever happened to those shows? I remember--you were amazing!"
